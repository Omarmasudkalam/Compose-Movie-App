## Built With üõ†

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android
  development.
- [Compose Constraint Layout](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/constraintlayout) - ConstraintLayout can help place 
  composables relative to others on the screen, and is an alternative to using multiple nested Row, Column, Box and custom layout elements. 
  ConstraintLayout is useful when implementing larger layouts with more complicated alignment requirements.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - A coroutine is a
  concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes
  asynchronously.
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Android‚Äôs
  modern toolkit for building native UI.
- [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - A flow is an asynchronous
  version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) -
  Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [Stateflow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - StateFlow is a
    state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
  - [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - A flow is an asynchronous
    version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores
    UI-related data that isn"t destroyed on UI changes.
  - [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection)
  - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt) - Easier way to incorporate Dagger DI into Android apps.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) - For writing Gradle build scripts using Kotlin.
